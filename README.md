# MapInfoService

### Description
This is project that  I carried out with my team on Rzethon (hackathon). It was in IOT category. On hackathon we had some platforms similar to arduino which counted people on the basis of MAC addresses but for presentation purpose I add data generator whos generate data randomly. Presentation layer based on Google maps.

### Requirements to run the project
- Postgres DB

### How it looks like:
On screen we see map with some points in Rzesz√≥w which are get from our database.  After 5 seconds colour of place can change because people leave or come to this place. .If we click on place we will see the info about some parameters. In left down corner we see position where we actually are.
